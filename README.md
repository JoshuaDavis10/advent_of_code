# ADVENT OF CODE SOLUTIONS 2025

## I had to give up at day 9 part 2

## the programs will only work on Linux and are simply compiled with gcc (if you have gcc installed just use the build.sh script in each part's directory)

## The day 8 solutions take ~30 minutes (maybe more, I didn't really time them), but the rest are effectively instant
